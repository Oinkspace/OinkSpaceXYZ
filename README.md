# üê∑ OinkSpace

**Smart and Simplified DeFi for Everyone.**

---

## What is OinkSpace?

OinkSpace is an innovative platform designed to democratize access to the universe of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Our mission is to make investing in cryptocurrencies and participating in complex DeFi strategies **simple, accessible, and highly effective**, even for those with no in-depth technical knowledge.

Inspired by the idea of a "smart piggy bank," OinkSpace offers automated tools for you to invest, generate passive income, and build your wealth securely and intuitively.

## üòü The Problem We Solve

The DeFi ecosystem is vast and full of opportunities, but its inherent complexity remains a significant barrier for many:
*   **Steep Learning Curve:** Technical jargon and confusing interfaces.
*   **Demanding Active Management:** Profitable strategies require time and knowledge for constant monitoring.
*   **Operational Complexity:** Difficulty in interacting with multiple protocols and managing risks.

OinkSpace was created to overcome these challenges!

## ‚ú® Our Core Solutions

We offer a suite of intelligent and automated tools:

### ü•û OinkSpace Stack
A revolutionary way for programmed (DCA) investment in crypto assets. The Stack not only buys automatically on dips but also uses trend-following protection logic (based on indicators like RSI) to optimize sell points and protects your unallocated capital by making it earn yield in stablecoin pools. **Set it once, and let the Stack work for you.**

**The Stack's Automated Workflow:**

### üíß OinkSpace Automated Pools
We radically simplify liquidity provision on DEXes like Uniswap V3. Deposit just a single token from the desired pair, and our system defines the best price range, actively manages your position, and automatically reinvests swap fees, maximizing your returns and minimizing stress.

## üöÄ Key Differentiators

*   **Radical Simplicity:** Intuitive interfaces and few-click processes.
*   **Intelligent Automation:** Data-driven strategies that work 24/7 for you.
*   **Educational Focus:** We believe in empowering our users with knowledge.
*   **Security as a Priority:** Committed to best practices and audits.
*   **Ecosystem Vision:** We plan to be your DeFi strategy enabler, simplifying and integrating the best of the DeFi universe.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Project Status

OinkSpace already has a functional version **(v.0.1.0-alpha.18)** operational on the mainnet: [https://app.oinkspace.xyz/](https://app.oinkspace.xyz/). This alpha version is being used for testing, feedback collection, and continuous optimization.

We are actively developing **OinkSpace V1**, which will feature an architecture based on **audited smart contracts** for greater decentralization, security, and non-custodial interaction, with an initial launch focus on the **Arbitrum One** network.
